# **Hi! ðŸ‘‹**

My name is Ben Borra, I'm a Software consultant at <a href="https://noest.be">Noest</a>.
<br>
I'm a full stack developer, but I'm mostly focussed in backend development. The goal of this website is to be a bit of a second brain and mostly a place to store my notes. I'm also planning to write some blog posts about things I'm interested in, things I encounter and want to share with the world.
